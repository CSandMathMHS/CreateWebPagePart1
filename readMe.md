Website Development Project
=
Part one - create your home page.
-
Ceate a home page that includes info about you and contains links to various projects.  Your page should include:
- Title: This will be what is written on the browser tab
- Header 1: The title of the page that shows up ON the page
- Header 2: The first paragraph title
- Paragraph(s): The first content (this should be a bit about yourself). Use page breaks where desired.
- Header 3: The title of the second paragraph group
- Paragraph(s): More content related to the projects
- Header 4: Links to Projects
  * Link 1: with an explanation of why you chose it
  * Link 2: with an explanation of why you chose it
  * Link 3: with an explanation of why you chose it

Use pictures to support your content.  It could be a picture of you (or of something that says something about you).  Use an actual picture that you have taken, not someting downloaded from the web.

We will discuss how to create web pages for your existing p5.js projects during the next class.  So, create the space and code for the links to your projects and we will fill that in after you learn to create the pages.
